Exercise: Simple RESTful API Server

Goal:
Build a basic HTTP server in Go that manages a list of tasks (a simple TODO API).

Requirements:

- Create a Task struct with fields: ID (int), Title (string), and Done (bool).
- Implement the following HTTP endpoints:
    GET /tasks — List all tasks.
    POST /tasks — Add a new task (accept JSON: { "title": "Buy milk" }).
    PUT /tasks/{id} — Mark a task as done.
    DELETE /tasks/{id} — Delete a task.
- Store tasks in memory (no database needed).
- Use the standard library (net/http, encoding/json).

Bonus:
Add error handling and return appropriate HTTP status codes.
